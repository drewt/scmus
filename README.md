scmus is an MPD client written in the (Chicken) scheme programming language.
scmus is similar to the cmus music player, with a few major differences:

* scmus is an MPD client
* scmus can be controlled and scripted using the Scheme programming language
* scmus is in the early stages of development


Building
--------

Requirements:

* CHICKEN 4
* ncurses

Consult http://wiki.call-cc.org/platforms for instructions on getting Chicken
