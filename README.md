scmus is an MPD client written in the (Chicken) scheme programming language.
scmus is similar to the cmus music player, with a few major differences:

* scmus is an MPD client
* scmus can be controlled and scripted using the Scheme programming language
* scmus is in the early stages of development


Building
--------

You'll need the Chicken scheme compiler/runtime to build and run scmus.
Consult http://wiki.call-cc.org/platforms for instructions on getting Chicken
on your platform.  You'll also need to install ncurses if it isn't installed
already.  Again, the procedure will depend on your platform.

First, run the configure script:

    $ ./configure

scmus depends on a few "eggs".  To install them:

    $ make eggs

To build scmus:

    $ make


Installation
------------

    # make install
